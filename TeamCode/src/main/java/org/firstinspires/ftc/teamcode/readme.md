##Welcome!

This GitHub repository contains the source code for Bosco Tech course CSEE 113, Introduction to Robotics. It is developed from https://github.com/first-tech-challenge/SkyStone designed to control a FIRST Tech Challenge competition robot for the SkyStone (2019-2020) season. FTC Team 5197 contributed most of the added code.

To use this SDK, download/clone this entire project to your local computer.

## Getting Started
The actual development was done with Android Studio.

Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo. Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

If you are a git user, you can get onto your command line and clone the most current version of this repository:
            git clone https://github.com/jrasor/csee113S20.git

Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.
Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the Releases page for this repository.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
